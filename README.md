# Smart Geolocation-Based Attendance and Verification System

A secure, web-based platform developed with Laravel that eliminates impersonation and remote attendance fraud among students through real-time geolocation validation and two-factor authentication.

## üéØ Project Overview

The Smart Geolocation-Based Attendance and Verification System is designed to revolutionize attendance management in educational institutions. Unlike conventional systems that rely on manual entry or facial recognition alone, this platform integrates cutting-edge geolocation technology with robust security measures to ensure authentic, location-verified attendance tracking.

## üîë Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Real-time Geolocation Validation**: Uses HTML5 Geolocation API to capture precise student coordinates
- **Distance-based Verification**: Validates attendance using the Haversine formula against predefined classroom locations
- **Radius-based Access Control**: Attendance only allowed within approved distance (e.g., 30 meters) from lecture venues
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Additional security layer using OTP verification via email or authenticator apps
- **Tamper-proof Records**: Comprehensive logging of timestamp, GPS coordinates, device information, and verification status

### Administrative Features
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Live attendance monitoring and analytics
- **Location Management**: Easy setup and management of classroom coordinates
- **User Role Management**: Granular permission system for administrators, lecturers, and students
- **Attendance Analytics**: Detailed reports and insights on attendance patterns
- **Map Visualization**: Interactive maps showing student locations and attendance zones

## üõ† Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Laravel 12.x (PHP 8.2+)
- **Frontend**: Livewire, Alpine.js, Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: Flux UI Library
- **Authentication**: Laravel Fortify with 2FA support
- **Database**: MySQL/PostgreSQL
- **Permissions**: Spatie Laravel Permission
- **Geolocation**: HTML5 Geolocation API
- **Maps**: Integration-ready for Google Maps or Leaflet.js
